            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student with a love for creating innovative solutions. I specialize in web
                development and have
                experience with Python, Java, C/C++, Javascript. I have also used other frameworks/libraries like React,
                Node.js, FastAPI, and Flask.

                <p>SynopSpy is a full stack web application that help users
                    understand and assess complex documents. Some examples of documents
                    SynopSpy helps analyze are legal fine print, court documents, or terms
                    and conditions. SynopSpy uses NLP(Natural Language Processing) to summarize
                    and analyze these documents, flag risky language, and assign a document
                    safety rating.

                        Developed a RESTful API with FastAPI, connected to a React
                        frontend via JavaScript.

                <p>TestTrack is a website that will help people keep track of the coronavirus
                    testing locations around their area. The website will prompt the user to
                    type in their zip code or address and will call certain Maps APIâ€™s
                    to locate the closest COVID-19 testing locations. We will also specify
                    the wait time allocated with each close testing location in order for them
                    to optimize their time and get tested as soon as possible.

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/ashram15/sorting_algorithms">Sorting Algorithm Visualizer</a></h2>
                <p>This project implements and benchmarks five common sorting algorithms in C++.
                    The algorithms implemented are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge
                    Sort.
                    The program then measures the time taken by each algorithm to sort these arrays and writes these
                    results
                    to a CSV file.
                    A python script (plot.py) then reads the CSV data and visualizes the performance of each sorting
                    algorithm using
                    Matplotlib. The resulting plot shows the sorting time(in seconds and in log scale) as a function of
                    array size (n).
